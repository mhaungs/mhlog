When using mhLog, only need to copy "mhlog.js".  The rest of the files and
directories are used for testing.  When testing, need to host files on
your own server (e.g. MAMP).

Note:  I have the -f flag in my git tag creation.  Should never do this
if anyone else uses this as could end up with the same tag have different states
depending on when you pulled it.  Need to get rid of the -f flag and just create a
brand new tag instead of updating the existing one.
